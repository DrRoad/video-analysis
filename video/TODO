* We might want to rename the composer to DebugVideo, since this might be a narrow use case        
* A better solution would be to refactor the class such that there is a Debugger/Observer class 
and a general VideoComposer class
* The mouse finder should be implemented as a listener to the blurred video
* The mouse model should take into account background intensities when doing the search
* Find cage box 
* Find sand line
