* Read video in separate threads, because they are IO bound (and do not need the GIL)
* Make mouse finding more robust, by keeping a score of how confident we are that we know where the mouse is
	- this score degrades over time, when we don't get a positional update
	- if the score drops below a threshold, we should consider looking for the mouse anywhere in the video
	- this should be done by using _find_mouse_in_binary_image
* Store meta information of video somewhere (especially date taken)
* Write a manual of assumption we make about the videos in order to track everything
* Build collection of extracts from movies which are hard to analyze (use this for semi-automatic testing)
* The sand profile sometimes has two brightnesses - What's the origin of this?
	- Maybe we could fit both of them simultaneously
* Speed up sand profile fitting by having a library of profiles with certain angles and just matching these
	around the point of interest (move along perpendicular line, until overlap is maximal)
* Find the burrow shape
	-  This might best be done on the background model (although it is blurred)
	- Burrows should be defined as dark areas underneath the sand profile line
