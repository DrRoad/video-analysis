* Allow to add a listener to the video fork children which gets notified before the
video advances to the next frame - this is important for the debug movie, which has to 
write out frames even if nothing was written to them
This would also allow us to skip the `index` in the current implementation of the composer
We might want to rename the composer to DebugVideo, since this might be a narrow use case
