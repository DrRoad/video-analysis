* The mouse finder should be implemented as a listener to the blurred video
* We need a slightly better background model - just using the minimum is not robust in bright areas
* Read video in separate threads, because they are IO bound (and do not need the GIL)
* Find cage box - we roughly know its size and could therefore do pattern matching on an image pyramid
* Find sand line
* We might want to rename the composer to DebugVideo, since this might be a narrow use case        
* A better solution would be to refactor the class such that there is a Debugger/Observer class 
and a general VideoComposer class
