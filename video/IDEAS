Mouse tracking
--------------
* Look into time smoothing (Gaussian smoothing across several frames)
* Connect several tracks to a single mouse trajectory

Burrow tracking
---------------
* Write separate class, which represents a burrow by and outline (similar to sand profile):
	- The two anchor points should be anchored to the sand profile line (and should probably be forbidden to move)
* We should be able to fit the burrow shape to the real data, using the explored area as an initial guess
* We could use a post-process run to extrapolate the predug size (considering the first frame should be sufficient here)
* This fitting should happen only every ~1000 frames and be done in a separate thread (such that we have about 40s per burrow)
