* Write a manual of assumption we make about the videos in order to track everything
* Gather more statistics about why certain parts of the algorithm failed
* Refine the centerline by moving the points more toward the actual center
	- this could be done by segmenting the current centerline in equally spaced segments
	- each inner point on this center line can be put at the midpoint between the outlines
		to prevent problems, the point should be displaced by at most 0.5*burrow_width
	- Alternatively, find centerline by using active snake guided by current centerline and distance map
* Pass1:
    - Improve ground line detection with more accurate snake minimization
        the snake dynamic variables are the distortions of each point perpendicular to the snake
        calculate the image contribution for each distortion (these should be independent of each other)
        calculate the curvature contribution (where only neighbors influence each other)
        evaluate all possible shapes and take the minimum
    - Move ground line fitting to separate process to speed up calculation
* Pass2:
* Pass3:
* Pass4:
	- connect two burrows that face each other (which happens for burrows with two exits)
* Add better structure for reporting the status of a pass:
    - provide additional PassBase class that contains functions managing the status
    - write status to YAML file immediately on update

Performance improvements:
-------------------------
* Make sure that images and masks are not copied to often (rather use internal cache structures, which should be faster)
	- Do operations in place as often as possible
* Generally cache all kernels for morphological operations, since these are costly to make
* Performance is limited by reading the video using ffmpeg (which is capped at about 50 fps)
